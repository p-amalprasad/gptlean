## Lean Module For Reasoning About Computaional Complexities

<img src="\src\img\Lean_GPT1.png" alt="lean" width="500px" height="500px" display="inline-block" margin-left="200px">

- **lean GPT modules**<br>
  Quantum Computational Complexity classes such as BGP(AWPP),BQP,BPP,PP,PSPACE are defined as modules in lean.

- **LeanDojo**<br>
  LeanDojo is a python library which extracts attributres and tactics from lean proofs to feed into a ReProved Deep Learning Model to generate a proof tree.

- **Reprover**<br>
  The extracted datas from LeanDojo are feeded into Reprover model (Retrival-Augmented Theorem Prover) which is used to create a proof tree and make tactics and suggestions.

- **API/Plugin**<br>
  LLMs like ChatGPT,Bard,Gemini are integrated with the Reprover model which suggest tactics for proof.
